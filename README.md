Here I solve tasks from my university (additional) course "Introduction to Java Enterprise Development".

The course consists of 4 modules:
- Module 1 &mdash; Java Core (Practice tasks)
- Module 2 &mdash; Client-server applications in Java. Development tools
- Module 3 &mdash; Client-server applications in Java. Web development
- Module 4 &mdash; Practice. Graduation project

We'll see if I add any more descriptions. For now that's it.
